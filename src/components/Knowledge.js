                  <p>

                    Many people wonder if the &quot;skin-to-skin&quot; feeling is better than using actual
                    condoms for protection. And if there is frequent &quot;skin-to-skin&quot; contact, does it

                    immediately increase the risk of sexually transmitted diseases? Today, we will
                    discuss this topic.
                    The issue of protection through condom usage depends on the agreement of
                    both parties involved. Whether it is a woman or a man, it is important for both
                    parties to have mutual consent, whether they choose to use a condom or not.
                    In general, we often hear many people believe that the sensation without
                    using condoms is better. However, the use of condoms is crucial for protection
                    against sexually transmitted infections. Condoms act as a barrier, reducing the
                    risk of transmitting diseases during sexual intercourse. While it is true that
                    some individuals may perceive a difference in sensation when using condoms,
                    it is important to prioritize safe sex practices to maintain sexual health.
                    However, this may not always be true because modern condoms are designed
                    to compete in terms of thinness, almost mimicking the feeling of not wearing
                    one. They provide a skin-to-skin sensation and even contain natural-feeling
                    lubricants. Many brands advertise the smoothness of their lubricants, claiming
                    they feel natural. However, there are some people who prefer to engage in
                    unprotected sex for various reasons, such as latex allergies or a sense of trust
                    when in a committed relationship.
                  </p>

                  <p>

                    Engaging in sexual activities outside of penetrative intercourse, such as mutual
                    masturbation or oral sex, also carries a risk of contracting sexually transmitted
                    diseases. Some individuals have a strong immune system that can fight off
                    infections, while others may be more susceptible to contracting diseases if
                    their immune system is compromised. Today, we will provide examples of
                    various diseases that can occur.

                    Debunking Common Misconceptions about HPV

                    In this blog, we will address common misconceptions surrounding HPV (Human Papillomavirus) and HPV testing. By dispelling myths and providing accurate information, we aim to equip you with the knowledge needed to take control of your sexual health. Let's dive in! Understanding HPV and its Link to Cervical Cancer:

                    HPV is a common sexually transmitted infection that affects both men and women. Contrary to popular belief, HPV is not limited to a specific group or age range. It can be transmitted through various sexual activities, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex, as well as through intimate skin-to-skin contact. One of the most significant misconceptions about HPV is its association with cervical cancer.
                  </p>

                  <p>

                    While it is true that certain high-risk strains of HPV can increase the risk of developing cervical cancer, it's important to note that not all HPV infections lead to cancer. Most HPV infections clear up on their own without causing any long-term health issues.

                    E-Cigarettes and Cervical Cancer

                    How can smoking increase the risk of cervical cancer? You might be wondering, given that smoke only enters the lungs, not the uterus or the vagina… wouldn’t it cause other cancers like oral, throat, or lung cancer? Seems more logical, right? With how e-cigarettes are readily available, let’s consider this.

                    Here me out, girls, smoking e-cigarettes can increase your chances of cervical cancer.

                    Not to blame the men in our lives, but studies illustrate that most men carry HPV without realizing it; thus, sexual intercourse accounts for 90% of transmission (other factors contribute the remaining 10%, such as public restrooms). It’s important to note that whatever sexual activities you involve may lead to cancer or warts due to HPV.
                  </p>

                  <p>

                    Even though vaping doesn't create combustion like rolled cigarettes or contain harmful substances like gamma radiation, carbon monoxide, rat poison, etc., however, one substance: e-cigarettes contain nicotine, which is also a carcinogen. Toxicologically, nicotine is considered toxic compared to other substances. It also potentially causes Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.

                    In more than 90% of individuals infected with HPV, their bodies can clear the infection on their own. However, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) survey in 2020, there were up to 60,400 new cases of cervical cancer and 34,200 deaths. Moreover, many cases remain untreated, with 90% of new infections and deaths occurring in low-income countries. Notably, over 90% of infections are attributed to sexual intercourse.

                  <p>

                    It has also been found that individuals infected with HIV are up to 6 times more likely to develop cervical cancer than those without HIV.
